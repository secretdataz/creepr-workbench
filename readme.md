Creepr Workbench
================

A starter site for a Minecraft server.

- User authentication system; tied to Minecraft username;
- Blog with templates for text, image, and video posts;
- Built on Bootstrap and the Laravel PHP framework;

Getting Started
---------------

Laravel is a PHP web application framework that utilizes the model-view-controller design pattern to facilitate tasks to different parts of the application. The models correlate to data stored in a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or otherwise). The controllers interact with data from the models and pass this data, manipulated or otherwise, to the views. Views are HTML files that have code which compiles to straightforward PHP. 

As I find more free time, and other people who are interested in contributing, I will begin making this source code more user friendly. At the moment, it is essentially the Creepr website. You will have to modify a few things in order to get things hooked up to your server. Things that come to mind at this point:

- Database Credentials
- Staff Profiles Page
- Server Status Widget

Once you connect this application to your database (from a fork of this repository, please), you can run the migrate command and clean everything out. The default account is as follows:

**username:** admin
**password:** password
